# Module 4: HTML & CSS - Animating & Transforming

Just a fun little page showing off some use of CSS animations using transitions and keyframes.
The eye in the middle is a SVG with one element animated indipendently of the rest.

The code should be pretty straightforward and easy to understand.
There are four animated elements, two of which animate without user input, two that animate on hover (or focus/active so it works on touchscreens also).
