# Module 4: HTML & CSS - Animating & Transforming

Just a fun little page showing off some use of CSS animations using transitions and keyframes.
The eye in the middle is a SVG with one element animated indipendently of the rest.

The code should be pretty straightforward and easy to understand.
There are four animated elements, two of which animate without user input and two that animate on hoverâ€”and also on active/focused so they should work on touch screens.
